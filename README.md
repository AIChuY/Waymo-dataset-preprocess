# Waymo-dataset-preprocess
Repo for preprocessing the Waymo Motion Dataset.

The goal is to preprocess the Waymo Motion Dataset to the fashion demonstrated in the papers "ChauffeurNet:Learning to Drive by Imitating the Best and Synthesizing the Worst" and "MultiPath++:Efficient Information Fusion and Trajectory Aggregation for Behavior Prediction".

Todo:
- [ ] Render the roadmap
- [ ] Render the traffic lights
- [ ] Render the agent boxes
- [ ] Data storage
- [ ] Line segment representation
