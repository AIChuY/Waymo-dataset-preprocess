# Waymo-dataset-preprocess
Repo for preprocessing the Waymo Motion Dataset.

The goal is to preprocess the Waymo Motion Dataset to the fashion demonstrated in the papers "ChauffeurNet:Learning to Drive by Imitating the Best and Synthesizing the Worst" and "MultiPath++:Efficient Information Fusion and Trajectory Aggregation for Behavior Prediction".

# Reference
Folder includes the papers that I refer to.

# Test_images
Folder includes some images generated by current codes.

The first level of folders indicates the index of scenario and the second level indicates the index of agents to predict in that scenario. The agents to predict are chosen according to the "tracks_to_predict" feature in the dataset.

In each folder, "road_map.png" is the local road map. "agents_i.png", "traffic_i.png" are the bounding box images and traffic light images "i" steps ago. And "agents.png", "traffic.png" are the the current bounding box images and traffic light images.

For the meaning of colors used in these images, please refer to the starting of utils.py.

# Todo:
- [x] Render the roadmap
- [x] Render the traffic lights
- [x] Render the agent boxes
- [ ] Speed up the codes
- [ ] Implement IO flow
- [ ] Data storage
- [ ] Line segment representation
